A lot of Warning will be issued at compile time due to the redefinition of BIT macros.
Could be removes by placing a #ifndef #BIT0 .. #endif arround the BIT macro in bits.h, 
and moving to the top of include list
	#include "datalink.h" in tsm.c, s_iam and in device.c
	#include "net.h" in bip.c and in bip.h (redondant include in bip.c)
	#include "bvlc.h" in bvlc.c
