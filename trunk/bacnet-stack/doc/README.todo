To Do List - BACnet Stack at SourceForge
Here are some things to do:

1. Finish demo/epics/main.c - EPICS demo. Use object property lists.
2. Finish demo/object/lo.c - Lighting Output object demo
3. Complete bvlc.c and use it instead of or in compliment to bip.c
4. Complete client demo for ReadPropertyMultiple from rpm.c
5. Add HTTP demo like bacnet4linux
6. Add subscribe COV support in server demo.
7. Add hooks to increment Database_Revision property
8. Add BBMD and FD support to server example for BACnet/IP.
9. Add Foreign Device registration options to client examples.
A. Change bip.c to not use extra buffer (shift data)
B. Add Visual Studio 2005 makefiles or projects for demos.
C. Add Code::Blocks projects for demos.
D. Add function headers to each module and function with 
    doc-tags for some document generator like doxygen, robodoc, 
    or Natural Docs.  Wikipedia has a nice comparison at:
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_documentation_generators
E. Convert core code into library.
   For example, libbacnet.  Includes client and server functionality
   and only requires a dummy tsm_free_invoke_id function for servers.
   Create bacnet.h file that includes all the necessary includes.
   Split core functions into files to make library effecient.
   For example, rp.c becomes rp_client.c, rp_server.c , rp_test.c;
   bacint.c becomes bacint_encode.c, bacint_decode.c, bacint_test.c
F: Change address to store in a file and demos to use file
   instead of having to send who-is for each query.
   Use a config file for interface and interface options.
   These will make scripting cleaner.

Will I use alphabet (G) or hex (10) for the next item?
