* Added Kconfig and bacnet-config.h options in ports/zephyr to keep small
  footprint for MCUs having less RAM.(#606)
* Added Keylist_Data_Free function to free all nodes and data in a list.(#595)
* Added basic Life Safety Zone object type in the apps/server example,
  with unit testing.(#595)

* Changed ZTEST_NEW_API adjustments as deprecated.(#601)
* Changed position of bacnet/bacdef.h to be the first bacnet header
  to include. BACnet headers need to pull in optional configuration and
  optional ecosystem overrides to allow integrators to control
  builds.  This change places bacnet/bacdef.h to the top of the BACnet 
  Stack header files to consistently introduce integrator and ports
  header files.(#598)(#600)

  differentiation object/basic/ai.c module.(#607)

* Fixed MSTP COBS frame encoding.(#592)
* Fixed router-ipv6 application for remote networks.(#592)

### Security

  to a BBMD (#586)
* Added an example application - bacdiscover - to discover devices and their

  uses a BACnet Discovery FSM module along with the BACnet R/W FSM.
  The BACnet Discovery module stores the binary property data in Keylists
  and includes device object property queries and iterators. (#583)
* Added callback from BACnet R/W FSM module for I-Am messages. (#583)

  APDU string of hex-ASCII. (#580)

  modules using Keylist_Key. Changed keylist module to use bool and
  stdint value for key not found. (#572)
* Added missing object functions to analog inputs and values. (#568)

### Changed

* Changed BACnet R/W FSM module to remove dependency on
  rpm_ack_decode_service_request() which uses large calloc/free
  value lists. Created an alternate RPM-ACK to RP-ACK processing 
  function. (#583)
* Changed basic RPM handler to skip over unknown property values. (#583)
* Changed the release script to use tag option and remove tag reminder.
  Fixed release tool to have a prefix folder with the tag version name.
  Enabled rebuilding tagged release code and zips in a working tree in temp folder.

### Fixed

* Fixed makefile for building the Linux router application. (#585)
* Fixed Command, Credential Data Input, and Schedule objects unit tests. (#578)

  Analog_Output_Present_Value_Set and Analog_Output_Present_Value_Write. (#575)

## [1.3.3] - 2024-02-2

### Security

* Secured the following services by refactoring the size check
  and refactoring the service requests from the service header,
  adding APDU size checking and length features, and adding unit
  tests to check for length when passing NULL buffer:
  ARF/AWF/COV/CO/DO/DCC/Event/GE/ALE/RLE/LSO/RD/RR/RP/WP. (#553)

### Added

* Added bacapp decoding for accumulator SCALE property. (#566)
* Added a MS/TP zero-config (automatically choose an unused MAC address)
  using an algorithm that starts with MAC=64 and waits for a random number
  of PFM (minimum of 8 plus modulo 64) before attempting to choose a MAC
  sequentially from 64..127. The confirmation uses a 128-bit UUID with the
  MSTP Test Request frame. The modifications are in src/bacnet/datalink/mstp.c
  and src/bacnet/datalink/dlmstp.c modules enabling any device to use
  zero-config if enabled. A working demonstration is in the ports/stm32f4xx
  for the NUCLEO board. Complete unit testing is included.  Options include
  lurking forever (wait for a router or another master node before joining)
  or lurking for a minimum time (enables self forming automatic MAC addressing
  device nodes). (#564)

  example device object. (#440)
* Added basic Time Value object, unit tests, and integration with
  example device object. (#440)

  and the SpecialEvent struct, encode/decode functions, unit tests, and
  integrated into bacapp functions. (#474)
* Added the DateRange struct for the Effective_Period property of Schedule,
  encode/decode functions, unit tests, and integrated into bacapp
  functions. (#474)

* Added CMake build option for stm32f4xx. Added fixes and comments to
  stm32f4xx example device.c from bacnet/basic/object/device.c module. (#556)

* Added minimim support for BACnet protocol-revision 0 through 24. See 
BACNET_PROTOCOL_REVISION define in bacdef.h
* Added example objects for color and color temperature, new for protocol-revision 24.
* Added current-command-priority to output objects revision 17 or later.

- Added IPv6 Foreign Device Registration and IPv6 support for BSD and macOS for apps
* Added example of spawning 100 servers using a BBMD connection.
* Added COBS encode and decode from BACnet standard (#183)
* Added Schedule encoding/decoding (#319)* Add What-Is-Network-Number and Network-Number-Is services (#304)
* Added BACDL_CUSTOM datalink define which allows for externally linked datalink_xxx functions (#292)
* Added Zephyr OS integration (see zephyr folder)

### Changed

* Modified example objects to support CreateObject and DeleteObject API for
these objects: file, analog output, binary output, multi-state output, color,
color temperature).
* Unit tests and functional tests have been moved from the source C files
into their own test files under the test folder in a src/ mirrored folder
structure under test/. 
* The testing framework was moved from ctest to ztest, using CMake, CTest, and LCOV. 
It's now possible to visually view code coverage from the testing of each file
in the library. The tests are run in continuous integration.  Adding new tests
can be done by as copying an existing folder under test/ as a starting point, and
adding the new test folder name into the CMakeLists.txt under test/ folder, or
editing the existing test C file and extending or fixing the existing test. 
* Most (all?) of the primitive value encoders are now using a snprintf()
style API pattern, where passing NULL in the buffer parameter will
return the length that the buffer would use (i.e. returns the length that the
buffer needs to be).  This makes simple to write the parent encoders to check
the length versus their buffer before attempting the encoding at the expense of
an extra function call to get the length.
* BACnetARRAY property types now have a helper function to use for encoding (see bacnet_array_encode) 

## Deprecated

* Added BACNET_STACK_DEPRECATED for functions which will be removed in a future
release, with a suggested replacement function to use instead.
