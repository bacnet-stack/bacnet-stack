- Added current-command-priority to output objects revision 17 or later.
- Added demo apps ack-alarm, add-list-element, and event (#418)
- Added UTC option to BACnet TimeSync app (#396)
- Added --time and --date options to command line time sync for override (#215)
- Added --retry option for repeating Who-Is or I-Am C number of times (#199)
- Added write BDT application (#170)
- Added repeat option to Who-Is and I-Am app (#117)
- Added UTF8 multibyte to wide char printing in ReadProperty and ReadPropertyMultiple 
apps if supported by the compiler and C library (#106).
- Added IPv6 Foreign Device Registration and IPv6 support for BSD and macOS for apps
- Added example of spawning 100 servers using a BBMD connection.
- Added COBS encode and decode from BACnet standard (#183)
- Added Schedule encoding/decoding (#319)* Add What-Is-Network-Number and Network-Number-Is services (#304)
- Added BACDL_CUSTOM datalink define which allows for externally linked datalink_xxx functions (#292)
- Added Zephyr OS integration (see zephyr folder)

### Changed

- Modified example objects to support CreateObject and DeleteObject API for 
these objects: file, analog output, binary output, multi-state output, color, 
color temperature). 
- Unit tests and functional tests have been moved from the source C files 
into their own test files under the test folder in a src/ mirrored folder 
structure under test/.  
- The testing framework was moved from ctest to ztest, using CMake, CTest, and LCOV.  
It's now possible to visually view code coverage from the testing of each file 
in the library. The tests are run in continuous integration.  Adding new tests 
can be done by as copying an existing folder under test/ as a starting point, and 
adding the new test folder name into the CMakeLists.txt under test/ folder, or 
editing the existing test C file and extending or fixing the existing test. 
- Most (all?) of the primitive value encoders are now using a snprintf() 
style API pattern, where passing NULL in the buffer parameter will 
return the length that the buffer would use (i.e. returns the length that the 
buffer needs to be).  This makes simple to write the parent encoders to check 
the length versus their buffer before attempting the encoding at the expense of 
an extra function call to get the length.
- BACnetARRAY property types now have a helper function to use for encoding (see bacnet_array_encode) 

## Deprecated

- Added BACNET_STACK_DEPRECATED for functions which will be removed in a future
release, with a suggested replacement function to use instead.
