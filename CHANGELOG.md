## [Unreleased]

### Security

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

### Removed

## [1.3.3] - 2024-02-2

### Security

 * Secured the following services by refactoring the size check
   and refactoring the service requests from the service header,
   adding APDU size checking and length features, and adding unit
   tests to check for length when passing NULL buffer:
   ARF/AWF/COV/CO/DO/DCC/Event/GE/ALE/RLE/LSO/RD/RR/RP/WP. (#553)

### Added

* Added bacapp decoding for accumulator SCALE property (#566)
* Added a MS/TP zero-config (automatically choose an unused MAC address)
  using an algorithm that starts with MAC=64 and waits for a random number
  of PFM (minimum of 8 plus modulo 64) before attempting to choose a MAC
  sequentially from 64..127. The confirmation uses a 128-bit UUID with the
  MSTP Test Request frame. The modifications are in src/bacnet/datalink/mstp.c
  and src/bacnet/datalink/dlmstp.c modules enabling any device to use
  zero-config if enabled. A working demonstration is in the ports/stm32f4xx
  for the NUCLEO board. Complete unit testing is included.  Options include
  lurking forever (wait for a router or another master node before joining)
  or lurking for a minimum time (enables self forming automatic MAC addressing
  device nodes). (#564)
* Added basic Calendar object, unit tests, and integration with
  example device object. (#440)
* Added basic Time Value object, unit tests, and integration with
  example device object. (#440)

  of Schedule, encode/decode/same functions, unit tests, and integrated
  into bacapp functions. (#474)
* Added the CalendarEntry struct for the Date_List property of Calendar
  and the SpecialEvent struct, encode/decode functions, unit tests, and
  integrated into bacapp functions. (#474)
* Added the DateRange struct for the Effective_Period property of Schedule,
  encode/decode functions, unit tests, and integrated into bacapp
  functions. (#474)
* Added Binary Lighting Output object example. (#522)
* Added more unit testing for device object.  (#522)
* Added CMake to AT91SAM7S port example. (#560)

* Added CMake build option for stm32f4xx. Added fixes and comments to
  stm32f4xx example device.c from bacnet/basic/object/device.c module. (#556)

tags. (#491)

* Added BACDL_CUSTOM datalink define which allows for externally linked datalink_xxx functions (#292)
* Added Zephyr OS integration (see zephyr folder)

### Changed

* Modified example objects to support CreateObject and DeleteObject API for
these objects: file, analog output, binary output, multi-state output, color,
color temperature).
* Unit tests and functional tests have been moved from the source C files
into their own test files under the test folder in a src/ mirrored folder
structure under test/. 
* The testing framework was moved from ctest to ztest, using CMake, CTest, and LCOV. 
It's now possible to visually view code coverage from the testing of each file
in the library. The tests are run in continuous integration.  Adding new tests
can be done by as copying an existing folder under test/ as a starting point, and
adding the new test folder name into the CMakeLists.txt under test/ folder, or
editing the existing test C file and extending or fixing the existing test. 
* Most (all?) of the primitive value encoders are now using a snprintf()
style API pattern, where passing NULL in the buffer parameter will
return the length that the buffer would use (i.e. returns the length that the
buffer needs to be).  This makes simple to write the parent encoders to check
the length versus their buffer before attempting the encoding at the expense of
an extra function call to get the length.
* BACnetARRAY property types now have a helper function to use for encoding (see bacnet_array_encode) 

## Deprecated

* Added BACNET_STACK_DEPRECATED for functions which will be removed in a future
release, with a suggested replacement function to use instead.
