Licenses for the BACnet Stack at SourceForge

This BACnet protocol stack implementation is specifically 
designed for the embedded BACnet appliance, using a GPL with 
exception license (like eCos), which means that any changes 
to the core code that are distributed must be made available
in accordance with section (3) of the GNU General Public License.
However, the BACnet library can be linked to proprietary code 
without the proprietary code becoming GPL.

The text of the GPL exception included in each source file 
is as follows:

    "As a special exception, if other files instantiate 
     templates or use macros or inline functions from 
     this file, or you compile this file and link it 
     with other works to produce a work based on this file, 
     this file does not by itself cause the resulting work 
     to be covered by the GNU General Public License. 
     However the source code for this file must still be 
     made available in accordance with section (3) of the 
     GNU General Public License."

Each file that is subject to the GPL uses the following text comment
at the top of the file:
