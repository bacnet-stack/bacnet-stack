Licenses for the BACnet Stack at SourceForge

This BACnet protocol stack implementation is specifically 
designed for the embedded BACnet appliance, using a GPL with 
exception license (like eCos), which means that any changes 
to the core code that are distributed must be made available
in accordance with section (3) of the GNU General Public License.
However, the BACnet library can be linked to proprietary code 
without the proprietary code becoming GPL.
