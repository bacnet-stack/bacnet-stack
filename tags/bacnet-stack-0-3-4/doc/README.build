BACnet Stack 
Developer Build

This BACnet Stack is designed as a library for an embedded product.  
However, there are a number of example applications in the demo/ directory
that show how it can be used for client and server applications.

The demos can be built using makefiles in the root directory, or by
using individual makefiles in the demo directories.
