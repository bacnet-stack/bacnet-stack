/** @defgroup RDMS  Device and Network Management Service BIBBs

 * 22.2.1.5 for the BACnet devices defined therein. 
 * 
 * The network management BIBBs prescribe the BACnet capabilities required to

 * 16.1 DeviceCommunicationControl Service <br>
 * The DeviceCommunicationControl service is used by a client BACnet-user to 
 * instruct a remote device to stop initiating and optionally stop responding 
 * to all APDUs (except DeviceCommunicationControl or, if supported, 
 * ReinitializeDevice) on the communication network or internetwork for a 
 * specified duration of time. This service is primarily used by a human operator
 * for diagnostic purposes. A password may be required from the client 
 * BACnet-user prior to executing the service. The time duration may be set to 
 * "indefinite," meaning communication must be re-enabled by a 
 * DeviceCommunicationControl or, if supported, ReinitializeDevice service, 
 * not by time.
                      *//** @defgroup NMRC Network Management-Router Configuration (NM-RC)
 * @ingroup RDMS
 * The A device may query and change the configuration of routers and 
 * half-routers.
 * The B device responds to router management commands and must meet the 
 * requirements for BACnet Routers as stated in Clause 6.
 * 
 * 6.4 Network Layer Protocol Messages <br>
 * This subclause describes the format and purpose of the ten BACnet network 
 * layer protocol messages. These messages provide the basis for router 
 * auto-configuration, router table maintenance, and network layer congestion 
 * control.
