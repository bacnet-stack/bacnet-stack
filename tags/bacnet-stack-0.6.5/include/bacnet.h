 *
 *  - The high-level handler interface can be found in the Modules tab.
 *  - Specifics for each file can be found in the Files tab.
 *  - A full list of all functions is provided in the index of the
 *  Files->Globals subtab.
 *
 * While all the central files are included in the file list, not all important
 * functions have been given the javadoc treatment, nor have Modules (chapters)
 * been created yet for all groupings.  If you are doing work in an under-
 * documented area, please add the javadoc comments at least to the API calls,
 * and consider adding doxygen's module grouping for your area of interest.
 *
 * See doc/README.doxygen for notes on building and extending this document. <br>
 * In particular, if you have graphviz installed, you can enhance this
 * documentation by turning on the function call graphs feature.
