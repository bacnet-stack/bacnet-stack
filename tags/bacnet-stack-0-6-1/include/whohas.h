 * The Who-Has service is used by a sending BACnet-user to identify the device
 * object identifiers and network addresses of other BACnet devices whose local
 * databases contain an object with a given Object_Name or a given Object_Identifier.
 * The I-Have service is used to respond to Who-Has service requests or to
 * advertise the existence of an object with a given Object_Name or
 * Object_Identifier. The I-Have service request may be issued at any time and
 * does not need to be preceded by the receipt of a Who-Has service request.
 * The Who-Has and I-Have services are unconfirmed services.
