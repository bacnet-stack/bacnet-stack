/** @defgroup DataLink The BACnet Network (DataLink) Layer
 * <b>6 THE NETWORK LAYER </b><br>
 * The purpose of the BACnet network layer is to provide the means by which 
 * messages can be relayed from one BACnet network to another, regardless of 
 * the BACnet data link technology in use on that network. Whereas the data 
 * link layer provides the capability to address messages to a single device 
 * or broadcast them to all devices on the local network, the network layer 
 * allows messages to be directed to a single remote device, broadcast on a 
 * remote network, or broadcast globally to all devices on all networks. 
 * A BACnet Device is uniquely located by a network number and a MAC address.
 * 
 * Each client or server application must define exactly one of these
 * DataLink settings, which will control which parts of the code will be built:
 * - BACDL_ETHERNET -- for Clause 7 ISO 8802-3 ("Ethernet") LAN
 * - BACDL_ARCNET   -- for Clause 8 ARCNET LAN
 * - BACDL_MSTP     -- for Clause 9 MASTER-SLAVE/TOKEN PASSING (MS/TP) LAN
 * - BACDL_BIP      -- for ANNEX J - BACnet/IP 
 * - BACDL_ALL      -- Unspecified for the build, so the transport can be 
 *                     chosen at runtime from among these choices.
 * - Clause 10 POINT-TO-POINT (PTP) and Clause 11 EIA/CEA-709.1 ("LonTalk") LAN
 *   are not currently supported by this project.
                                              *//** @defgroup DLTemplates DataLink Template Functions
 * @ingroup DataLink
 * Most of the functions in this group are function templates which are assigned
 * to a specific DataLink network layer implementation either at compile time or
 * at runtime.
